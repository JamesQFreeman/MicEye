Why use MicEye Versatile As a label tool, we support class label (keyboard typing) bounding boxes (mouse draw) keypoint label (use eye gaze) During aforemention annotation process, all eye movement will be recorded. Cheaper Start your research using less than 200 usd! Comparing to other existing software, we use cheaper and more common hardware, i.e., Tobii Eye Tracker 4C and Tobii Eye Tracker 5. Easier Here we domonstrate some use cases, you can use it on the go with a laptop or use it on your desk monitor. And the code is easy to modify since it is PyQt. You can try it for fun! I understand there are some better eye tracking software out there. However, they are too expensive and hard to use for someone who are trying for fun. And I do believe trying for fun is great, that's why I spent time to organize the code, add comments and docs even I know more thorough literature can be found. At beginning it was not a very serious idea during the pandemic lockdown to combine eye-tracking and medical image analysis (which is my PhD project). After some google search, I found the Tobii Eye-tracker are surprisingly affordable, so I bought it with my own money (my prof paid it soon after). There're no easy-to-use API so at the beginning I record the screen with a red bubble and post-process the video. And we started with the showing cat/dog using PPT so every one in the lab are interesting to take part in. Then I wrap the c++ sdk in python and start to writing the program which become the MicEye now. A demo We domonstrate an example of radiologist reading knee X-Ray images. Of cause, you could use it in natural image. This red bubble is for demonstration, do not exist in real software.

The data collection begin with typing the name name down. And a message is shown to the volunteers to tell them how the experiment is setted up. You can modify the message at main.py . Simply look Just press the \"Enter\" for the next image. Gaze will be recorded. Type to label This is for quantification/classification. For example, in knee X-Ray image, there is a quantification criteria named KL-Grade, range from 0 to 4, 0 means healthy and 4 is very ill. If do cat/dog classification, type 0 for cat and 1 for dog. It's on you. Draw bounding boxes You can add bounding boxes by click \"Add Bounding Boxes\", then draw some boxes.
